The file RandomWDN.py is a python script for generating random water distribution networks from street network data. To run  this file you need:

- To have the packages in 'requirements.txt' installed.

- To have the corresponding conda environment spec-list 'conda_env.txt'.

- To have internet access.

- When running the file you will be asked for Gmap_key (for help see: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key), it will be used for downloading elevation data.

- And finally you will be asked to specify the number of WDNs you want to be generated. 

An 'output' directory wiil be created where the generated files will be saved. Happy generating!
